**Examples of how I've applied R, Shiny, and software engineering across internal tools, public-sector systems, and open-source projects.**

### **Open Source Contribution – Apache Arrow Project**  
**Type:** Open Source Development & Authoring  

I've been an active contributor to the Apache Arrow R package, where I've worked on extending `dplyr` support to Arrow - enabling high-performance data manipulation in-memory and across file systems. I've also written and taught extensively on the topic, including:

- **[Big Data in R with Arrow workshop](https://posit-conf-2024.github.io/arrow/)** at Posit Conf in 2023 and 2024
- **[Scaling up with R and Arrow](https://arrowrbook.com)** - a full-length book on working with large datasets in R using Arrow, to be published in print in 2025  

This work shapes how I think about reproducibility, performance, and long-term support in both open source and consulting contexts.

### **Supporting Genomic Medicine in the NHS with R and Shiny**  
**Type:** Client Project (Team Build)  

As part of a cross-functional team, I contributed to a modular Shiny application supporting the rollout of genomic testing within the NHS - building on the 100,000 Genomes Project. The app allowed operational staff, lab teams, and programme managers to track genomic samples and view key metrics without needing to work directly with the complex backend systems.

**What I worked on:**  

- UI and server logic across multiple Shiny sub-apps  
- Integration with APIs and SQL databases 
- Interactive visualisations using plotly, visNetwork, sunburstR  
- Refactoring and scaling reactive code for performance

The app was built to support a national rollout and continues to be used across NHS teams.

### **Refactoring a Legacy Shiny App for Maintainability**  
**Type:** Internal Tooling (Team Lead)  

While at Novartis, I led a small team responsible for maintaining an internal Shiny app used to manage R package installation requests. The codebase had become increasingly fragile and hard to maintain, with tightly coupled logic and growing technical debt.

**What I worked on:**  

- Refactored reactive logic to simplify control flow and heavily modularised code to support maintainability
- Introduced testing strategies and CI workflows  
- Improved onboarding for new developers by making the codebase easier to understand

The changes made the application significantly more maintainable and safer to extend as the team evolved.

### **Scoping a Large-Scale SAS to R Migration**  
**Type:** Consulting – Code Audit & Planning  

As part of a consultancy engagement, I audited a large SAS codebase to help a client understand the feasibility and risk profile of migrating to R. The codebase was business-critical and had grown organically over many years.

**What I worked on:**

- Static code analysis of SAS codebase to estimate size and complexity (e.g. SQL-style vs. custom PROC logic)  
- Identified areas where statistical methods or parameter defaults might behave differently in R  
- Delivered a scoped migration plan to help inform budget, risk, and staffing decisions

The audit helped the client avoid assumptions about direct conversion and provided a structured way to evaluate next steps.
