**I'm Nic Crane. I help teams get more value out of R by making their code easier to trust, maintain, and deploy.**

Over the past decade, I've worked across software engineering, data science, and open source - often in settings where R is used seriously, but the surrounding infrastructure hasn't quite kept up. My work sits in the space between research and production: refactoring code, improving workflows, and helping teams ship things that work reliably.

I've worked in pharma, public health, academia, and startups - and I'm comfortable moving between technical and domain-focused teams. Some highlights:

- I contributed to the Apache Arrow R project, where high standards for performance and cross-platform reliability are non-negotiable
- I've built dashboards and internal tools that were deployed across the NHS
- I've led workshops at major R conferences and co-authored an online course on R package development

Most of the teams I work with don't need huge platforms or full rewrites - they just need their existing work to be a bit more maintainable, a bit more reliable, and a lot easier to work with.

If that's where you are, I can help.
