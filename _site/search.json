    "text": "I’m Nic Crane; a data scientist and software engineer working at the intersection of analysis and engineering. I help teams using R build robust, maintainable tools, or improve the ones they already rely on.\nOver the past decade, I’ve worked across software engineering, data science, and open source; using R in production to support complex workflows and help teams get more from their data.\nI work across the lifecycle: designing and delivering new internal tools, auditing and refactoring fragile codebases, and advising teams on architecture, scaling, and deployment. Most of my work sits somewhere between building from scratch and making sense of what already exists.\nI’ve worked in pharma, public health, academia, and startups, and I’m comfortable moving between technical and domain-focused teams. Some highlights:\n\nI contributed to the Apache Arrow R project, acting as package maintainer and co-authoring Scaling Up with R and Arrow - available online and published by CRC Press in 2025\n\nI’ve built dashboards and internal tools supporting hundreds of concurrent users, deployed across the NHS; see my Posit Conf talk from 2019\n\nI’ve led workshops at major R conferences like Posit Conf; see the Big Data in R with Arrow workshop\n\nWhether you’re designing something new, scaling something fragile, or just trying to make your R code easier to work with, I can help.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet in touch →"

    "text": "Practical R consulting \nHere are some examples of the kinds of projects I work on:\n\n\n1. Designing and Building Internal Data Tools\nIf your team has useful data but no clear way to surface it, I can help design and build tools that make it accessible. That might be a Shiny dashboard, an automated report, or something more custom, depending on what decisions it needs to support.\nI work closely with teams to understand what’s needed, assess what data is already there, and build tools that fit into existing workflows. Sometimes that means starting from scratch. Other times it’s about rebuilding something that kind of works, but isn’t stable or maintainable.\nI’ve worked on tools used by clinical and research teams across the NHS, and contributed to internal dashboards for large-scale open source and government projects. My focus is always on making things more usable and supportable; not just technically functional, but something people can actually work with.\n\n\n\n2. Strengthening R Code for Production Use\nCode that works isn’t always code you can rely on long-term. I help teams review existing R codebases to spot problems early, simplify what’s fragile, and make things easier to maintain.\nThis could mean cleaning up tangled logic, adding input checks, improving structure, or setting up basic CI. I’ve done this in both internal teams and open-source settings; including refactoring legacy pipelines, improving test coverage, and contributing to production-grade packages.\nSometimes this looks like a one-off review with a write-up of risks and priorities. Other times it turns into hands-on help refactoring or modernising what’s there. Either way, the focus is practical: what’s working, what might break later, and what’s worth fixing now.\n\n\n\n3. Planning and Delivering Migrations to R from SAS, Stata, or Excel\nTools like SAS, Stata, or Excel still underpin a lot of internal workflows but they’re often hard to scale, audit, or maintain. I help teams plan and deliver migrations to R that are practical, phased, and grounded in how the tools are actually used.\nThat starts with scoping: reviewing existing scripts, mapping dependencies, and figuring out what can be translated directly versus what needs redesign. From there, I can help implement the migration; reverse-engineering legacy logic, rebuilding it in R, and setting things up for long-term use.\n\n\n\n4. General R Consulting and Team Support\nI also offer flexible support for teams working in R at a more general level where my skillset is a good match for the project.\n\nSee selected projects →\nGet in touch →"

    "text": "Examples of how I’ve applied R, Shiny, and software engineering across internal tools, public-sector systems, and open-source projects.\n\n\nOpen Source Contribution – Apache Arrow Project\nType: Open Source Development & Authoring\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve been an active contributor to the Apache Arrow R package, where I’ve worked on extending dplyr support to Arrow - enabling high-performance data manipulation in-memory and across file systems.\nThis work has influenced how I approach performance, reproducibility, and maintainability - both in open source and in client projects.\n\nBig Data in R with Arrow – workshop taught at Posit Conf (2023, 2024)\n\nScaling up with R and Arrow – co-authored book on large-scale data workflows in R, due out in 2025\n\n\n\n\nSupporting Genomic Medicine in the NHS with R and Shiny\nType: Client Project (Team Build)\n\n\n\n\n\nI contributed to a modular Shiny application used in the national rollout of genomic testing within the NHS, building on the 100,000 Genomes Project.\nIt let operational staff, lab teams, and programme managers track genomic samples and view key metrics without needing to interact directly with backend systems.\nWhat I worked on:\n- UI and server logic across multiple Shiny sub-apps\n- Integration with APIs and SQL databases\n- Interactive visualisations using plotly, visNetwork, sunburstR\n- Refactoring and scaling reactive code for performance\nThe app was built to support a national rollout and continues to be used across NHS teams.\nWatch the talk →\n\n\n\nRefactoring a Legacy Shiny App for Maintainability\nType: Internal Tooling (Team Lead)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile at Novartis, I led a small team responsible for maintaining an internal Shiny app used to manage R package installation requests.\nThe codebase had become increasingly fragile and hard to maintain, with tightly coupled logic and growing technical debt.\nWhat I worked on:\n- Refactored reactive logic to simplify control flow and heavily modularised code to support maintainability\n- Introduced testing strategies and CI workflows\n- Improved onboarding for new developers by making the codebase easier to understand\nThe changes made the application significantly more maintainable and safer to extend as the team evolved.\n\n\n\nScoping a Large-Scale SAS to R Migration\nType: Consulting – Code Audit & Planning\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of a consultancy engagement, I audited a large SAS codebase to help a client understand the feasibility and risk profile of migrating to R. The codebase was business-critical and had grown organically over many years.\nWhat I worked on:\n- Static code analysis of SAS codebase to estimate size and complexity (e.g. SQL-style vs. custom PROC logic)\n- Identified areas where statistical methods or parameter defaults might behave differently in R\n- Delivered a scoped migration plan to help inform budget, risk, and staffing decisions\nThe audit helped the client avoid assumptions about direct conversion and provided a structured way to evaluate next steps.\nGet in touch →"
