    "text": "Examples of how I’ve applied R, Shiny, and software engineering across internal tools, public-sector systems, and open-source projects.\n\n\nOpen Source Contribution – Apache Arrow Project\nType: Open Source Development & Authoring\nI’ve been an active contributor to the Apache Arrow R package, where I’ve worked on extending dplyr support to Arrow - enabling high-performance data manipulation in-memory and across file systems. I’ve also written and taught extensively on the topic, including:\n\nBig Data in R with Arrow workshop at Posit Conf in 2023 and 2024\nScaling up with R and Arrow - a full-length book on working with large datasets in R using Arrow, to be published in print in 2025\n\nThis work shapes how I think about reproducibility, performance, and long-term support in both open source and consulting contexts.\n\n\n\nSupporting Genomic Medicine in the NHS with R and Shiny\nType: Client Project (Team Build)\nAs part of a cross-functional team, I contributed to a modular Shiny application supporting the rollout of genomic testing within the NHS - building on the 100,000 Genomes Project. The app allowed operational staff, lab teams, and programme managers to track genomic samples and view key metrics without needing to work directly with the complex backend systems.\nWhat I worked on:\n\nUI and server logic across multiple Shiny sub-apps\n\nIntegration with APIs and SQL databases\nInteractive visualisations using plotly, visNetwork, sunburstR\n\nRefactoring and scaling reactive code for performance\n\nThe app was built to support a national rollout and continues to be used across NHS teams.\nWatch the talk →\n\n\n\nRefactoring a Legacy Shiny App for Maintainability\nType: Internal Tooling (Team Lead)\nWhile at Novartis, I led a small team responsible for maintaining an internal Shiny app used to manage R package installation requests. The codebase had become increasingly fragile and hard to maintain, with tightly coupled logic and growing technical debt.\nWhat I worked on:\n\nRefactored reactive logic to simplify control flow and heavily modularised code to support maintainability\nIntroduced testing strategies and CI workflows\n\nImproved onboarding for new developers by making the codebase easier to understand\n\nThe changes made the application significantly more maintainable and safer to extend as the team evolved.\n\n\n\nScoping a Large-Scale SAS to R Migration\nType: Consulting – Code Audit & Planning\nAs part of a consultancy engagement, I audited a large SAS codebase to help a client understand the feasibility and risk profile of migrating to R. The codebase was business-critical and had grown organically over many years.\nWhat I worked on:\n\nStatic code analysis of SAS codebase to estimate size and complexity (e.g. SQL-style vs. custom PROC logic)\n\nIdentified areas where statistical methods or parameter defaults might behave differently in R\n\nDelivered a scoped migration plan to help inform budget, risk, and staffing decisions\n\nThe audit helped the client avoid assumptions about direct conversion and provided a structured way to evaluate next steps."

    "text": "Practical R consulting — from new tool design to legacy migrations.\nI help teams using R build and maintain robust, production-grade tools and workflows. That might mean designing something new, strengthening what already exists, or figuring out how to modernise a fragile setup. My work spans projects at every stage from initial scoping and architecture to delivery and support.\nI’ve worked with organisations in research, healthcare, government, and early-stage startups - usually where R is already in use, but teams need clearer structure, more confidence in their tooling, or help scaling what they’ve built.\nHere are some common ways I help:\n\n\n1. Designing and Building Internal Data Tools\nIf your organisation has useful data but no clear way to surface it, I can help design and build tools that make those insights accessible. That might mean a Shiny dashboard, an automated reporting pipeline, or something more tailored.\nI work with teams to understand the decisions they need to support, assess the data available, and develop tools that fit into existing workflows. This could mean creating something from scratch or rebuilding an existing tool to make it more usable, stable, and easier to support.\nFor example, I helped develop a large-scale Shiny app deployed across the NHS, used by clinicians and lab teams to track genomic sample metadata. The app was modular, backed by a database, and designed to be supportable at scale.\n\n\n\n2. Strengthening R Code for Production Use\nCode written for analysis often works - but it’s rarely ready for handover, scaling, or long-term use. I offer structured audits of R codebases to assess their readiness for production and suggest practical improvements across structure, testing, packaging, and deployment.\nThese are short, self-contained pieces of work (typically 1–3 days) that result in a clear report - highlighting what’s working, what might break later, and what to prioritise next. It’s designed to surface risks and opportunities early, especially if you’re thinking about scaling, rewriting, or handing over the codebase. In some cases, it can also serve as a starting point for a broader refactor or support engagement.\nThis draws on experience refactoring messy internals, simplifying logic, adding CI, and reviewing open source contributions for Apache Arrow. The goal is always to improve robustness and maintainability without overengineering.\n\n\n\n3. Migrating from Legacy Tools to Open Source R Workflows\nTools like Excel, SAS, or Stata are still widely used, but can be limiting - expensive, inflexible, and hard to integrate. I help teams explore and plan a move to R: starting with an audit of existing code and workflows, then identifying what can be translated directly, what needs rethinking, and what risks to watch for.\nI start with a review of your existing code and workflows to map what can be converted easily, what needs redesign, and where risks sit. One past project involved analysing a large SAS codebase to scope out a realistic migration path — surfacing complexity early to avoid costly surprises later.\n\n\n\n4. General R Consulting and Team Support\nNot everything fits into a box. Sometimes you need an outside perspective on a flaky pipeline, help shaping a new workflow, or someone to scope a project before committing dev time.\nI also offer short advisory engagements, mentoring for internal developers, and lightweight architecture or code reviews. These can be standalone or follow on from an audit or build.\n\n\n\nHow I Work\nSome teams I work with already have something in place - a script, a dashboard, or an internal package. Others are just starting to design what they need.\nMy job is to help you move forward with less guesswork and more clarity. Sometimes that means giving you a roadmap, and other times it means building the thing. Always, it’s about finding the simplest, most practical solution for your context.\nSee selected projects → Get in touch →"
