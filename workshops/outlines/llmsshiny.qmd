### Workshop Overview

Large language models (LLMs) are transforming how we work, but using them effectively—especially within the R ecosystem—requires careful design and deployment. The {ellmer} package simplifies access to LLMs in R, making it easier to build AI-powered applications, automate workflows, and extract structured insights from unstructured data. But how do you move from experimentation to real-world deployment?

This hands-on workshop will guide you through practical applications of LLMs in R, using {ellmer} to integrate AI capabilities into Shiny apps. We’ll cover:

-   prompt design and engineering
-   the {ellmer} R package
-   creating LLM-powered Shiny apps
-   deploying LLM-powered Shiny apps

Throughout the session, I'll balance hands-on coding with discussion of best practices for deploying LLM-powered automation responsibly. Whether you're an R developer exploring AI for the first time or looking to integrate LLMs into business workflows, this workshop will equip you with the tools and techniques to deploy AI-powered solutions confidently.

Participants should have basic familiarity with R and some experience working with Shiny apps. Code examples and exercises will be provided to reinforce key concepts. Information will be provided ahead of the workshop about packages to install and any other technical prerequisites.
