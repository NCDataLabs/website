### **What I Do**

Hi, I'm Nic! I'm a data scientist, software engineer, and R developer. I am part of the team who maintain the arrow R package and co-author of Scaling Up with R and Arrow.

I help organisations get more value from their R code, whether that means designing and building internal tools from scratch, strengthening fragile workflows, or planning a move away from legacy systems like SAS or Excel.

### **A Bit About Me**

I've spent the last decade working across data science, software engineering, and open source; contributing to the Apache Arrow R project, building tooling used in the NHS, and teaching at international R conferences.
