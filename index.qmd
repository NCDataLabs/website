### **What I Do**  
I help organisations get more value from their R code, whether that means designing and building internal tools from scratch, strengthening fragile workflows, or planning a move away from legacy systems like SAS or Excel.

I’ve worked with teams at different stages; sometimes helping turn a vague idea into a working tool, other times stepping in when a Shiny app or internal script has grown too complex to manage easily. In either case, the goal is the same: to make things more robust, maintainable, and supportable as they scale.

I offer R consulting across strategy, architecture, and hands-on development.

Some common ways I help include:  
- Building internal dashboards and reporting tools  
- Reviewing and strengthening existing R workflows  
- Planning and delivering migrations to R from tools like SAS or Excel  
- Training and mentoring teams in R  
- Practical advice on growing and supporting R infrastructure

### **Who I Work With**  

I work with teams in sectors like healthcare, government, pharma, and early-stage startups; often where R is already in use, but workflows are inconsistent or starting to strain under new demands.

Whether you're starting from scratch or maintaining something that's grown organically, I help you figure out what’s working, what’s fragile, and what’s needed to move forward with less risk and more clarity.

### **A Bit About Me**  

I’ve spent the last decade working across data science, software engineering, and open source; contributing to the Apache Arrow R project, building tooling used in the NHS, and teaching at international R conferences.
