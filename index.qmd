### **What I Do**  
I help organisations get more value from their R code, whether that means strengthening existing scripts, building internal data tools, or migrating from legacy systems like SAS or Excel.

Most of the teams I work with already have something in place: a Shiny app, a set of scripts, or a few internal packages. What they need is help making it more robust, more maintainable, and easier to support as it becomes more central to their work.

At NC Data Labs, I offer:

- **Code audits and production support** for R workflows
- **Development of internal dashboards and tools**
- **Migration planning** from legacy tools to open-source R solutions

### **Who I Work With**  
Clients include teams in healthcare, government, pharma, and early-stage startups - usually those working with R, but facing growing pains as their tooling scales.

Whether you're maintaining code that’s grown organically over time or looking to make better use of your internal data, I work with you to identify what’s working, what’s fragile, and what’s needed to move forward with less risk and more confidence.

### **A Bit About Me**  
I’ve spent the last decade working across data science, software engineering, and open source - including contributing to the Apache Arrow R project, building tooling used within the NHS, and delivering workshops at international R conferences.
