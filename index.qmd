### **What I Do**  
I help organisations get more value from their R code, whether that means designing and building internal tools from scratch, strengthening fragile workflows, or planning a move away from legacy systems like SAS or Excel.

Some teams come to me with an idea they want to make real. Others already have something in place - a Shiny app, a few internal packages, or a growing tangle of scripts - and need help making it more robust, maintainable, and supportable as it becomes central to their work.

At NC Data Labs, I offer general R consulting — from strategy and architecture to hands-on development.

Some common ways I help clients include:

- **Development of internal dashboards and tools**  
- **Code audits and production support** for existing R workflows  
- **Migration planning** from tools like SAS, Stata, or Excel to R  
- **Training and upskilling** teams in R  
- **Advisory support** for teams growing or standardising their use of R

### **Who I Work With**  

Clients include teams in healthcare, government, pharma, and early-stage startups - usually those working with R, but facing growing pains as their tooling scales or their needs shift.

Whether you're starting fresh or maintaining something that's grown organically,  I work with you to understand what's working, what's fragile, and what's needed to move forward with less risk and more confidence.

### **A Bit About Me**  

I've spent the last decade working across data science, software engineering, and open source - including contributing to the Apache Arrow R project, building tooling used within the NHS, and delivering workshops at international R conferences.
