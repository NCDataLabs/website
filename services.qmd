**Practical R consulting — for new builds, existing codebases, and migration planning.**

I help teams using R make their workflows more stable, usable, and production-ready. That might mean designing a tool from scratch, strengthening something fragile, or figuring out how to move away from legacy systems.

I tend to work with organisations where R is already in use, but things feel a bit scattered — workflows are inconsistent, code is hard to hand over, or there’s no clear path from prototype to production. I help bring structure to that.

Most of my work falls into one of four areas:

---

### **1. Designing and Building Internal Data Tools**

If your team has useful data but no clear way to surface it, I can help design and build tools that make it accessible. That might be a Shiny dashboard, an automated report, or something more custom, depending on what decisions it needs to support.

I work closely with teams to understand what’s needed, assess what data is already there, and build tools that fit into existing workflows. Sometimes that means starting from scratch. Other times it’s about rebuilding something that kind of works, but isn’t stable or maintainable.

I’ve worked on tools used by clinical and research teams across the NHS, and contributed to internal dashboards for large-scale open source and government projects. My focus is always on making things more usable and supportable — not just technically functional, but something people can actually work with.

### **2. Strengthening R Code for Production Use**

Code that works isn’t always code you can rely on long-term. I help teams review existing R codebases to spot problems early, simplify what’s fragile, and make things easier to maintain.

This could mean cleaning up tangled logic, adding input checks, improving structure, or setting up basic CI. I’ve done this in both internal teams and open-source settings — including refactoring legacy pipelines, improving test coverage, and contributing to production-grade packages.

Sometimes this looks like a one-off review with a write-up of risks and priorities. Other times it turns into hands-on help refactoring or modernising what’s there. Either way, the focus is practical: what’s working, what might break later, and what’s worth fixing now.

---

### **3. Planning and Delivering Migrations to R from SAS, Stata, or Excel**

Tools like SAS, Stata, or Excel still underpin a lot of internal workflows — but they’re often hard to scale, audit, or maintain. I help teams plan and deliver migrations to R that are practical, phased, and grounded in how the tools are actually used.

That starts with scoping: reviewing existing scripts, mapping dependencies, and figuring out what can be translated directly versus what needs redesign. From there, I can help implement the migration — reverse-engineering legacy logic, rebuilding it in R, and setting things up for long-term use.

This kind of work is a good fit when the scope is clear and the migration needs to be done carefully, not just quickly. I’ve done this for research and reporting pipelines, including analysis of large SAS-based systems, and know how to handle mess and ambiguity without getting stuck in it.

### **4. General R Consulting and Team Support**

Not everything fits into a neat category. Sometimes you need a second pair of eyes on a fragile pipeline, help shaping a new workflow, or someone to make sense of a half-built tool before you commit more dev time.

I offer flexible support for teams working in R; from lightweight code or architecture reviews to mentoring and advisory sessions. This can be a one-off chat, a review of a specific part of a codebase, or an ongoing check-in as things evolve.

This is often a good entry point when you're not sure what you need yet, but know something needs to change.

### **How I Work**

Some teams I work with already have something in place; a dashboard, a package, a half-working script. Others are just starting to design what they need.

Wherever you're starting from, my job is to help you move forward with less guesswork and more clarity. Sometimes that means reviewing what's already there. Other times, it's helping you scope or build something new. Either way, the focus is on making things simpler, more stable, and easier to support over time.
