**Practical R consulting — from new tool design to legacy migrations.**

I help teams using R build and maintain robust, production-grade tools and workflows. That might mean designing something new, strengthening what already exists, or figuring out how to modernise a fragile setup. My work spans projects at every stage from initial scoping and architecture to delivery and support.

I've worked with organisations in research, healthcare, government, and early-stage startups - usually where R is already in use, but teams need clearer structure, more confidence in their tooling, or help scaling what they’ve built.

Here are some common ways I help:

---

### **1. Designing and Building Internal Data Tools**

If your organisation has useful data but no clear way to surface it, I can help design and build tools that make those insights accessible. That might mean a Shiny dashboard, an automated reporting pipeline, or something more tailored.

I work with teams to understand the decisions they need to support, assess the data available, and develop tools that fit into existing workflows. This could mean creating something from scratch or rebuilding an existing tool to make it more usable, stable, and easier to support.

For example, I helped develop a large-scale Shiny app deployed across the NHS, used by clinicians and lab teams to track genomic sample metadata. The app was modular, backed by a database, and designed to be supportable at scale.

### **2. Strengthening R Code for Production Use**

Code written for analysis often works - but it's rarely ready for handover, scaling, or long-term use. I offer structured audits of R codebases to assess their readiness for production and suggest practical improvements across structure, testing, packaging, and deployment.

These are short, self-contained pieces of work (typically 1–3 days) that result in a clear report - highlighting what's working, what might break later, and what to prioritise next.  It's designed to surface risks and opportunities early, especially if you’re thinking about scaling, rewriting, or handing over the codebase. In some cases, it can also serve as a starting point for a broader refactor or support engagement.

This draws on experience refactoring messy internals, simplifying logic, adding CI, and reviewing open source contributions for Apache Arrow. The goal is always to improve robustness and maintainability without overengineering.

### **3. Migrating from Legacy Tools to Open Source R Workflows**

Tools like Excel, SAS, or Stata are still widely used, but can be limiting - expensive, inflexible, and hard to integrate. I help teams explore and plan a move to R: starting with an audit of existing code and workflows, then identifying what can be translated directly, what needs rethinking, and what risks to watch for.

I start with a review of your existing code and workflows to map what can be converted easily, what needs redesign, and where risks sit. One past project involved analysing a large SAS codebase to scope out a realistic migration path — surfacing complexity early to avoid costly surprises later.

### **4. General R Consulting and Team Support**

Not everything fits into a box. Sometimes you need an outside perspective on a flaky pipeline, help shaping a new workflow, or someone to scope a project before committing dev time.

I also offer short advisory engagements, mentoring for internal developers, and lightweight architecture or code reviews. These can be standalone or follow on from an audit or build.

---

### **How I Work**  

Some teams I work with already have something in place - a script, a dashboard, or an internal package. Others are just starting to design what they need.

My job is to help you move forward with less guesswork and more clarity. Sometimes that means giving you a roadmap, and other times it means building the thing. Always, it's about finding the simplest, most practical solution for your context.
