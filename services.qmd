**Practical R consulting **

Here are some examples of the kinds of projects I work on:

---

### **1. Designing and Building Internal Data Tools**

If your team has useful data but no clear way to surface it, I can help design and build tools that make it accessible. That might be a Shiny dashboard, an automated report, or something more custom, depending on what decisions it needs to support.

I work closely with teams to understand what's needed, assess what data is already there, and build tools that fit into existing workflows. Sometimes that means starting from scratch. Other times it's about rebuilding something that kind of works, but isn't stable or maintainable.

I've worked on tools used by clinical and research teams across the NHS, and contributed to internal dashboards for large-scale open source and government projects. My focus is always on making things more usable and supportable; not just technically functional, but something people can actually work with.

### **2. Strengthening R Code for Production Use**

Code that works isn't always code you can rely on long-term. I help teams review existing R codebases to spot problems early, simplify what's fragile, and make things easier to maintain.

This could mean cleaning up tangled logic, adding input checks, improving structure, or setting up basic CI. I've done this in both internal teams and open-source settings; including refactoring legacy pipelines, improving test coverage, and contributing to production-grade packages.

Sometimes this looks like a one-off review with a write-up of risks and priorities. Other times it turns into hands-on help refactoring or modernising what's there. Either way, the focus is practical: what's working, what might break later, and what's worth fixing now.

### **3. Planning and Delivering Migrations to R from SAS, Stata, or Excel**

Tools like SAS, Stata, or Excel still underpin a lot of internal workflows but they're often hard to scale, audit, or maintain. I help teams plan and deliver migrations to R that are practical, phased, and grounded in how the tools are actually used.

That starts with scoping: reviewing existing scripts, mapping dependencies, and figuring out what can be translated directly versus what needs redesign. From there, I can help implement the migration; reverse-engineering legacy logic, rebuilding it in R, and setting things up for long-term use.

### **4. General R Consulting and Team Support**

I also offer flexible support for teams working in R at a more general level where my skillset is a good match for the project.
