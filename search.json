    "text": "I’m Nic Crane; a data scientist and software engineer working at the intersection of analysis and engineering. I help teams using R build robust, maintainable tools, or improve the ones they already rely on.\nOver the past decade, I’ve worked across software engineering, data science, and open source; using R in production to support complex workflows and help teams get more from their data.\nI work across the lifecycle: designing and delivering new internal tools, auditing and refactoring fragile codebases, and advising teams on architecture, scaling, and deployment. Most of my work sits somewhere between building from scratch and making sense of what already exists.\nI’ve worked in pharma, public health, academia, and startups, and I’m comfortable moving between technical and domain-focused teams. Some highlights:\n\nI contributed to the Apache Arrow R project, acting as package maintainer and co-authoring Scaling Up with R and Arrow - available online and published by CRC Press in 2025\n\nI’ve built dashboards and internal tools supporting hundreds of concurrent users, deployed across the NHS; see my Posit Conf talk from 2019\n\nI’ve led workshops at major R conferences like Posit Conf; see the Big Data in R with Arrow workshop\n\nWhether you’re designing something new, scaling something fragile, or just trying to make your R code easier to work with, I can help."

    "text": "Practical R consulting for new builds, existing codebases, and migration planning.\nI help teams using R make their workflows more stable, usable, and production-ready. That might mean designing a tool from scratch, strengthening something fragile, or figuring out how to move away from legacy systems.\nI tend to work with organisations where R is already in use, but things feel a bit scattered — workflows are inconsistent, code is hard to hand over, or there’s no clear path from prototype to production. I help bring structure to that.\nMost of my work falls into one of four areas:\n\n\n1. Designing and Building Internal Data Tools\nIf your team has useful data but no clear way to surface it, I can help design and build tools that make it accessible. That might be a Shiny dashboard, an automated report, or something more custom, depending on what decisions it needs to support.\nI work closely with teams to understand what’s needed, assess what data is already there, and build tools that fit into existing workflows. Sometimes that means starting from scratch. Other times it’s about rebuilding something that kind of works, but isn’t stable or maintainable.\nI’ve worked on tools used by clinical and research teams across the NHS, and contributed to internal dashboards for large-scale open source and government projects. My focus is always on making things more usable and supportable — not just technically functional, but something people can actually work with.\n\n\n\n2. Strengthening R Code for Production Use\nCode that works isn’t always code you can rely on long-term. I help teams review existing R codebases to spot problems early, simplify what’s fragile, and make things easier to maintain.\nThis could mean cleaning up tangled logic, adding input checks, improving structure, or setting up basic CI. I’ve done this in both internal teams and open-source settings — including refactoring legacy pipelines, improving test coverage, and contributing to production-grade packages.\nSometimes this looks like a one-off review with a write-up of risks and priorities. Other times it turns into hands-on help refactoring or modernising what’s there. Either way, the focus is practical: what’s working, what might break later, and what’s worth fixing now.\n\n\n\n3. Planning and Delivering Migrations to R from SAS, Stata, or Excel\nTools like SAS, Stata, or Excel still underpin a lot of internal workflows — but they’re often hard to scale, audit, or maintain. I help teams plan and deliver migrations to R that are practical, phased, and grounded in how the tools are actually used.\nThat starts with scoping: reviewing existing scripts, mapping dependencies, and figuring out what can be translated directly versus what needs redesign. From there, I can help implement the migration — reverse-engineering legacy logic, rebuilding it in R, and setting things up for long-term use.\nThis kind of work is a good fit when the scope is clear and the migration needs to be done carefully, not just quickly. I’ve done this for research and reporting pipelines, including analysis of large SAS-based systems, and know how to handle mess and ambiguity without getting stuck in it.\n\n\n\n4. General R Consulting and Team Support\nNot everything fits into a neat category. Sometimes you need a second pair of eyes on a fragile pipeline, help shaping a new workflow, or someone to make sense of a half-built tool before you commit more dev time.\nI offer flexible support for teams working in R; from lightweight code or architecture reviews to mentoring and advisory sessions. This can be a one-off chat, a review of a specific part of a codebase, or an ongoing check-in as things evolve.\nThis is often a good entry point when you’re not sure what you need yet, but know something needs to change.\n\n\n\nHow I Work\nSome teams I work with already have something in place; a dashboard, a package, a half-working script. Others are just starting to design what they need.\nWherever you’re starting from, my job is to help you move forward with less guesswork and more clarity. Sometimes that means reviewing what’s already there. Other times, it’s helping you scope or build something new. Either way, the focus is on making things simpler, more stable, and easier to support over time.\nSee selected projects →\nGet in touch →"

The codebase was business-critical and had grown organically over many years.\nWhat I worked on:\n- Static code analysis of SAS codebase to estimate size and complexity (e.g. SQL-style vs. custom PROC logic)\n- Identified areas where statistical methods or parameter defaults might behave differently in R\n- Delivered a scoped migration plan to help inform budget, risk, and staffing decisions\nThe audit helped the client avoid assumptions about direct conversion and provided a structured way to evaluate next steps."
